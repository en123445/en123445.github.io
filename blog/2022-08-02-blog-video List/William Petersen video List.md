4.    The Contender (2000)
    - Character: Governor Jack Hathaway, governor of Virginia
    - Has a major chunk of screen time at the beginning of the movie, couple of small scenes somewhere in the middle and a major scene near the end
    - A lot of people don't like this movie, but I found it rather interesting and I'm also a big Joan Allen fan

![Docusaurus Plushie](./WPAP_SKULLS_HD_021-s.jpg)  

6.    Kiss The Sky (1999)
    - Character: Jeff
    - MUST SEE WP movie!!!  Definite buy and keep.
    - BBBB - what more can I say -> 同意作者的说法，我是跳着看的，因为觉得过于羞耻了 XD 三人行什么的！还有他在海里展示的白皙圆润的臀部~ PS：床戏是GSR某同人图的原片
    - FYI: Patricia Charbonneau, who plays Franny, was also in MANHUNTER withWP.  She was the wife of the third family that the Tooth Fairy was agoing to kill. 
    - You don't see her in the theatrical version because the scene where Will Graham goes to the last family's house is cut from this version.  It's in the director's cut.

8.    The Staircase (1998) (TV movie)
    - Character: Joad
    - Must see WP movie. If you can get your hands on a copy -- do it.
    - This is one of my favorite characters.  WP plays a very soft-spoken man who comes out of no where and builds a spiral staircase for a chapel.  This is based on a true story
    - FYI: Barbara Hershey, who plays Mother Madalyn, is also in RETURN TO LONESOME DOVE with WP.
    - 以前油管上有来着，大概

    - FYI: The woman who plays Grace, the waitress at the bar where Jakes hangs out, also played Lady Heather on CSI
    - FYI: The guy in bed with Jake's wife/girlfriend at the beginning of the movie is the same guy who plays Hank on CSI. -> 这俩是真心不对付了 XD

10.   The Beast (1997) (shorten version of mini series)
    - Character:  Whip Dalton
    - This is the video release of the TV mini series.
    - The squid is rather laughable, but WP is easy on the eyes in his beard and bigsweaters

11.  12 Angry Men (1997) (TV movie)
    - Character:  Juror #12
    - The main characters in this movie are George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon, but the movie is worth watching for the great ensemble cast
    - It's a remake of the 1957 movie of the same name starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb.  
    - (The 1957 version was directed by Sidney Lumet and the 1997 version was directed by Willilam Friedkin who directed WP in TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA.)
    - Even though WP is a minor character, I recommend this movie (both versions) due to the subject and the great acting in both versions)
    - 陪审团...纯台词...看不懂 Orz

![Docusaurus Plushie](./12angrymen-s.jpg)  

12.   Mulholland Falls (1996)
    - Character:  Some Mafia mobster
    - WP is seen only briefly on screen in a scene where is is killed.
    - I would recommend this to only the true die-hard WP fan -- otherwise, you're going to be disappointed.
    - 真就一个镜头，让人从山上扔下去了...

![Docusaurus Plushie](./12angrymen-s.jpg)  
 
14.    Fear (1996)
             -         Character:  Steve Walker
             -     This is a fun movie to watch just to see WP beat up on psycho Mark Wahlburg. 
             -         Recommended WP viewing. 
                   (I don't mean fun as in "funny movie" because it's about a psycho boyfriend.)
             -     FYI:  Although they didn't share any scenes, Reese Witherspoon was in RETURNTO LONESOME DOVE with WP
             -     Can be found on video and DVD
 
15.    In The Kingdom Of The Blind (1995)
             -         Character:  Tony C.
             -     WP has a minor role in this movie about good cops, bad cops and the mob. 
             -     I would recommend this to only the true die-hard WP fan -- otherwise, you're going to be disappointed.

    - I didn't think that this was a good as the original LONESOME DOVE, but I lovedit more than the first one
    - FYI: Re-teamed with Barbara Hershey from THE STAIRCASE
    - WP with a beard, chaps and riding a horse -- what more can I say.

    - This is available only on video in the US, but has recently been released on DVDoverseas in Region 1. Hopefully, before too long it will be released on DVD in the US. Until then, we have to make do with the video version. BEWARE WHEN BUYING THE VIDEO VERSION. Don't buy it if it comes on one tape. This has been recorded at a slower speed and the picture quality isn't a good. There also may be scenes missing. If you buy the video, make sure it's on at least two tapes. The best way to go is the 4 tape box set. You can find these for sale on Ebay.

20. Keep The Change (1992) (TV movie)
    - Character: Joe Starling a modern day cowboy
    - Another favorite of mine
    - Must see WP movie. Definite buy and keep.

    - Can be found on video

21. Passed Away (1992)
    - Character: Frank Scanlon

    - This is a fun movie to watch. Recomended WP viewing.

    - Must see WP movie. Definite buy and keep
    - FYI: The teacher Joey runs into in the hallway is the same woman who played
Lureen in KEEP THE CHANGE
    - I believe this may be out of print, but you can still find the video on Ebay and other places on the net

23. Young Guns II (1990)
    - Character: Pat Garrett
    - More chaps, more horses, WP, Keifer and Viggo. What more could a girl ask for?
    - If you like westerns, you'll ove this one. If you love WP movies, you'll love this one. This is one sequel that I enjoyed more than the original.
    - Recommended WP viewing. Buy and keep.
    - This has got a great soundtrack by Bon Jovi.
    - Can be found on video and DVD

24. Kennedys Of Massachusetts, The (1990) (TV mini series)
    - Character: Joe Kennedy, Sr.
    - He played Jack Kennedy in THE RAT PACK, now he's playing his father Joe. This is a really different look for WP. He actually had his head shaved to get the "Joe Kennedy look" for this mini series. He plays Joe from his college days and courtship of Rose through to Jack's inaugration as President.
    - Recommended WP viewing. Buy and keep.
    - This is available in limited supply on video. It is no longer being printed. You can sometimes find it on Ebay. It's a 3 tape set.

27. Long Gone (1987) (TV movie)
    - Character: Cecil "Stud" Cantrell
    - OMG! One of the beset WP characters.
    - Must see WP viewing. Definite buy and keep.
    - If you liked BULL DURHAM then you'll LOVE this one. LONG GONE is way better than BULL DURHAM.
    - Available on video.

28. Manhunter (1986)
    - Character: Will Graham
    - This is the best Hannibal Lector movie. I really like Anthony Hopkins, but MANHUNTER is my favorite.
    - Recommended WP viewing. Definite buy and keep.
    - Available on video and DVD. I would recommend buying the double DVD which contains both the theatrical release and the director's cut. Although the quality of the director's cut isn't that great, it does have the missing scenes replaced in it.

    - This movie is long out of print, but can be found on video. It was released on by two different companies. One version was taped at EP speed and the otheras SP speed. Most copies of either are usually worn and grainy. There's talk that this may be put on DVD sometime in the future. Here's hoping.

30. Twilight Zone, The (1985) (Need To Know)
    - Character: Edward Sayers
    - This isn't the old B&W Twilight Zone and it's not the new one that's running on UPN. This is The Twilight Zone that came out in the 80's and ran for a short time. The episode was titled "Need To Know" and was one of two stories on the half hour show.
    - Recommended viewing.
    - If you watch carefully, you may be able to catch this on TNT. They sometimes run the 80's version of TZ really early in the morning on the weekends.
