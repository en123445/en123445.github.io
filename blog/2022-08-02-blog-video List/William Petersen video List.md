-  Twilight Zone, The (1985) (Need To Know)
    - Character: Edward Sayers
    - This isn't the old B&W Twilight Zone and it's not the new one that's running on UPN. This is The Twilight Zone that came out in the 80's and ran for a short time. The episode was titled "Need To Know" and was one of two stories on the half hour show.
    - Recommended viewing.
    - 貌似「Twilight Zone」是美国一部历史挺悠久的科幻片？灵异片？系列，前后拍过好几遍，他在1985年版演过一集
    - 是非常可爱的小鲜肉！被吓坏了的那种~
    - 以前油管上有来着，大概

*************

-  To Live And Die In LA (1985）
    - Character: Richard Chance
    - Very violent film, but worth watching. Buy and keep.
    - FYI: The director, William Friedkin, also directed WP in 12 ANGRY MEN
    - This movie is long out of print, but can be found on video. It was releasedon by two different companies. One version was taped at EP speed and theotheras SP speed. Most copies of either are usually worn and grainy. There'stalk that this may be put on DVD sometime in the future. Here's hoping.
    - 最重要的一点是，有！裸！戏！外粉还给镜头截图调成了高清...
    - 貌似导演很有名，近年还拍了纪录片，里面当然有采访到William Petersen，他应该也是从这会儿开始火的，之前大概都在剧场
    - 根据William Petersen的 [HALF HOURd采访](https://www.steppenwolf.org/tickets--events/half-hour-theatre-podcast/?fbclid=IwAR37fG6yNBhWEAmOJLkX1LdAwbipWEHuHEv2ywgMC4tPfQQT7zm_YEBK3kM) "SEASON 1 - Ep4"，说他被邀请到导演家里念了一段台词，然后就被录用了~

    - This is the best Hannibal Lector movie. I really like Anthony Hopkins, but MANHUNTER is my favorite.
    - Recommended WP viewing. Definite buy and keep.
    - Available on video and DVD. I would recommend buying the double DVD which contains both the theatrical release and the director's cut. Although the quality of the director's cut isn't that great, it does have the missing scenes replaced in it.
    - FYI: The wife in the third family is the same woman who plays Franny in KISS THE SKY. This third family is seen only in the home movies in the theatrical release, but are in one of the missing scenes that have been replaced in the director's cut.
    - 应该很有名，CSI第一季的时候DVD还宣传了一波儿（故事本身好像也很出名，红龙前传的样子，就是和汉尼拔有一点关系）

    - Character: Joe Kennedy, Sr.
    - He played Jack Kennedy in THE RAT PACK, now he's playing his father Joe. This is a really different look for WP.

    - The main characters in this movie are George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon, but the movie is worth watching for the great ensemble cast
